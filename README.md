## Description
Early detection of depressive symptoms can be an important step for evaluation, intervention, and prevention of recurrence. This project 
proposes a machine-learning algorithmic rule to develop an early prediction from their depression mode, which may 
be shielded from mental disease and suicide state of affairs. The mixture of sensors and MADRS analysis along with machine learning algorithm together 
will help to determine the level of depression with great accuracy.
